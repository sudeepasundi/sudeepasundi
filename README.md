- 👋 Hi, I’m Sudeep_Asundi  
- 👀 I’m interested in VLSI SoC design and Software development  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced RTL design, DFT, STA, and layout design as a VLSI SoC Design Trainee.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to low-power memory design, digital accelerators, and communication protocols.  
- 📫 How to reach me: [sudeepasundi15@gmail.com](mailto:sudeepasundi15@gmail.com) | [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sudeep-asundi)   
- ⚡ Fun fact: I find joy in creating innovative hardware solutions—and when I’m not debugging circuits, I’m probably strategizing for my next eSports tournament!
